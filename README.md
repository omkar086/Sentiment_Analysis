# 📊 Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on textual data to classify it as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to process text and build predictive models.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Sentiment analysis is a sub-field of NLP that determines the emotional tone behind a body of text. This project aims to:
- Clean and preprocess textual data.
- Train a model to classify sentiment.
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.
- Deploy a basic UI/API for real-time sentiment prediction (optional).

---

## 🚀 Features

- Text cleaning & preprocessing (stopwords removal, lemmatization, etc.)
- Visualizations: word clouds, sentiment distribution, etc.
- Multiple model comparisons: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Interactive prediction (via command line, web app, or API)

## 📈 Model Performance

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 86.24%   | 0.844     | 0.850  | 0.846    |
| SVC Model           | 86.12%   | 0.843     | 0.848  | 0.844    |

## 🧼 Preprocessing Steps:

- Lowercasing.
- Removing punctuation and special characters.
- Removing stopwords
- Tokenization
- Lemmatization

---

##📌 Future Improvements:

- Integrate LSTM/BERT for better accuracy.
- Real-time sentiment analysis from Twitter API.
- Deploy as REST API using Flask/FastAPI
- Multilingual sentiment analysis
